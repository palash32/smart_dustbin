*Smart IoT Dustbin Project*

*Overview:*
This project aims to create a smart IoT dustbin using an Arduino board and a Wi-Fi module. The dustbin will be equipped with sensors to detect the level of waste and will be able to communicate this information to a server or a mobile application via Wi-Fi, enabling efficient waste management.

*Features:*
1. Real-time monitoring of waste level.
2. Wi-Fi connectivity for remote access.
3. Alert system for when the dustbin is full.
4. Data logging for waste management analysis.
5. Modular design for easy customization and expansion.

*Components:*
- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Wi-Fi module (e.g., ESP8266)
- Ultrasonic sensor for waste level detection
- LEDs for status indication
- Power source (battery or AC adapter)
- Dustbin enclosure

*Setup:*
1. Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the Arduino board.
2. Connect the LEDs to the Arduino board for status indication.
3. Connect the Wi-Fi module to the Arduino board.
4. Place the components inside the dustbin enclosure, ensuring proper positioning for waste level detection.
5. Power up the system and configure the Wi-Fi module to connect to the desired network.

*Usage:*
1. The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance to the waste level.
2. The Arduino board processes the sensor data and sends it to the server or mobile application via the Wi-Fi module.
3. Users can monitor the waste level in real-time through the provided interface.
4. When the dustbin is full, the system triggers an alert to notify the user or the waste management authority.
5. Data logging allows for analysis of waste generation patterns and optimization of collection schedules.
